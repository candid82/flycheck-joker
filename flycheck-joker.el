;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds Clojure syntax checker (via Joker) to flycheck.  To use it, add
;; to your init.el:

;; (require 'flycheck-joker)

;; Make sure Joker binary is on your path. Joker version v0.9.7 or greater is required.
;; Joker installation instructions are here: https://github.com/candid82/joker#installation
;;
;; Please read about Joker's linter mode to understand its capabilities and limitations:
;; https://github.com/candid82/joker#linter-mode
;; Specifically, it's important to configure Joker to reduce false positives:
;; https://github.com/candid82/joker#reducing-false-positives
;;
;; Please see examples of the errors Joker can catch here:
;; https://github.com/candid82/SublimeLinter-contrib-joker#examples
